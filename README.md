# hello-world

Hi!

I'm @LegendaryPrincess.  I'm intrested in learning all that I need to know to become successful in this world.
I am a noob to all of this stuff but I'm excited to learn, I'm currently learning how to work in GitHub.
I'm looking to colorabate on anything thats meant for beginners at this time.  How to reach me would be to @ me in a pull request...i think.
I'll update my info when I learn a little more about the system.
